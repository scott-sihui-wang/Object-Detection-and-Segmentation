# Object Detection and Segmentation

## 1. Introduction

In this project, I used `Faster R-CNN` + `ResNeXt-101` + `FPN` + `Nested UNet` for the detection and segmentation of planes.

This project, with its codes and generated outcomes, is hosted on `Colab` at [Project Page - Part 1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TSSWE-MK9oMgyO7_nkwZrFnukKzbco5P?usp=sharing) and [Project Page - Part 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kEhLJPAgAhhUHkAh3tqjc_RDHT83LiJr?usp=sharing). For overview, technical details, and analysis of this project, please refer to my [report](report.pdf).
